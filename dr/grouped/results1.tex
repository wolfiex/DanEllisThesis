\section{Results}\label{sec:drres}
% 
There exist many methods to define the chemical structure of the species within the MCM. In this section we attempt to evaluate their effectiveness for exhibiting the defining functional groups and charactaristics used for constructing the mechanism. First we explore the distribution of clusters, and the ability of different DR algorithms to visually separate various groups of chemistry (\autoref{sec:cldist}). Next the functional groups (taken from the MCM development protocol) are explored within each DR algorithm (\autoref{sec:fsclust}). Finally a selected example for each DR method is taken and explored in further detail (\autoref{sec:selectcomp}).

\subsection{Cluster distribution}\label{sec:cldist}

Start with the visual comparison and compare it with the silhouette values.
