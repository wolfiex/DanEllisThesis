\section{Results}
% 
% There exist many methods to define the chemical structure of the species within the MCM. In this section we shall attempt to evaluate their effectiveness for exhibiting the defining functional groups and charactaristics used for constructing the mechanism. In order to do this, we shall use a range of linear and non-linear DR techneques as a means of clustering the data. 

\subsection{CLuster distribution}

Start with the visual comparison and compare it with the silhouette values.
