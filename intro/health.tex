\section{Motivation}

Air pollution and climate have always been a concern for the human race. Concerns about lead in the air can be documented back as far as 6000 years ago [se ref, ], in ancient Rome [1145] and in 1285 where after a visit from Queen of England to a coal burning to Nottingham, the first air pollution act was deployed [1147]. Modern day

\section{Ozone and its role}
Ozone has two roles within the atmosphere. High up in the stratosphere it servers as a barrier to dangerous ultraviolet radiation. The importance of this was discovered in (HOLE PAPER) where the release of CloroFlouroCarbons from deodorants produced ...

However within the troposhere (<15k?) the production and loss of ozone has a direct impact on human life. Polluted environments, such as industrial London,

\section{The NOx cycle}
Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) come predominantly from motor verhicles and power stations and can cause respiotory problems in children and asmatics [se1261]. They also play an important role in the formation and destruction of ozone.
