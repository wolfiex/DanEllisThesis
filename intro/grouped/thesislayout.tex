\section{Thesis Layout}
This thesis will explore a series of methods for describing and understaning the complex chemistry which may exist as part of an atmospheric chemistry mechanism. The mechanism used is a near-explicit representation of our foremost understanding of how gas phase chemistry in the troposphere reacts - the Master Chemical Mechanism, \citep{mcm}.

We begin by exploring the use of visualisation to convey complex scientific data (\autoref{ch:vis}). Next we apply this to the representation of species in a mechanism, and the relationships between them. To do this it is found that the node-link style graph format is the most beneficial, the use of which is then explored further (\autoref{ch:graph}). \autoref{ch:}
