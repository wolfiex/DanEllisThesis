\section{Case study Example}\label{sec:metriccase}
In this section the centrality metrics discussed in \autoref{sec:graphcentrality} are applied to a range of senarios. These range from polluted urban environments such as London [REF] and Beijing [REF], to marine and terrestial forrest- Cape Verde REF and Borneo REF. We determine the main drivers for the chemistry and compare the species which are important across each simulation.  

\subsection{Establishing Initial Conditions from observational data}
Within experimental data assimulation it is not uncommon to face problems which resut in unreliable or missing data. These can range from anything as little as measuring below the instrument sensitivity to powercuts and equiptment damage/theft from the local wildlife. This can result in problems when analysing the results and combining them to create a simulation of the chemistry for that environment. 

To overcome this, traditionally a combination of data filtration, smoothing and interpolation is required. Although it is possible to fit a diurnal profile, through itereative methods of comparison, and cubic splines, a much simpler way would be to use an Multi Layer Perceptron Regressor model (MLPRegressor) as provided by sklearn, \citep{sklearn}. This is described below.

\subsubsection{The origin of Artificial Neural Networks}
The concept of a neural network originated witin the field of neuroscience. In in bilogical neurons, signals are sent through the use of electrical impulses using their synapses. When a sufficient number of signals are recieved within a short timeframe, a neurone will respond, often firing a range of its own signals. Using this as a foundation,\cite{pitts} presented a computational model of the biological neuron - the artifical neuron. This has a series of binary inputs, and produces a single binary output. This idea was later imporoved with the invention of the perceptron - a linear classifier which classifies categories by separating them with a straight line. Invented by \cite{perceptron}, this was popularised as a device representative of a modern day shallow neural network - \citep{perceptronmanual}, \autoref{fig:perceptron}. Unlike the artificial neuron however, the perceptron is able to take non-binary (numerical) inputs of an associated weight which allows for the computation of simple linear binary classification. Much like Logistic regression, the preceptron produces a positive or negative classification based on a certain threshold\footnote{It is worth noting that while a Logistic Regression classifier can output a class probability, the use of a hard threshold means that this is not done within the preceptron algorithm \citep{handsonml}}.

        \label{fig:perceptron}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The Multi Layer Perceptron}
Limitations of ther perceptron include the classifiction of complex patterns such as the XOR problem (where a category appears between two other categories e.g. {1|0|1} - this cannot be classified by a single linear split). In taking inspiration from nature, \autoref{fig:layercortex}, it is possible to overcome this with the use of multiple layers. This creates an a deep ($>2$ two hidden (non-input) layers of perceptrons\footnote{These are sometimes refered as Linear Threshold Units.}) artificial neural network (ANN) 

The multi layer perceptron (MLP) model now represents a simple feed-forwards network, much like a decision tree. However unlike a decision tree, the MLP ANN is able to describe the probability a branch is taken using non-linear activation (threshold) functions. These are discussed in detail as part of \autoref{sec:ae}. The weighting thresholds for each neuron are then calculated by backwards propagation of results through the network until a suitably good result is produced. 

\begin{quote}
\textit{
\textbf{Example analogy:} Back propagation can be likened to the iterative calibration of scientific instrumentation. In the field of atmopsheric chemistry laser induced flourecence is used to calculate species concentrations and reaction rates within the troposphere, \citep{lif1,lif2}. Here the frequency of a laser can be adjusted in contrast with a known target (e.g. an amount of \ce{SO2}) to produce a responce curve showing where the maximum resonance occurs.\\
Similarly a neural network can be `trained' (calibrated). 
This is done through the use of a `training dataset' - a set of input-output pairings which represent a random selectaion of 2/3rds of the total dataset. Next the neurons within each layer (similar to the potentiometer dials on an instrument) are adjusted in sequence through the layers to match the known result (a standard of known concentration) to the input values provided. This process is repeated until for a number of iterations, or until a sufficently `good' prediction is attained for the entire training dataset (early termination). The power of ANNs comes from the ability to adjust neuron thresholds whilst moving both forwards and backwards through the network (Note: predictions of a MLP are still only passed forwards). Finally model perfomance is evaluated against the remaining 1/3rd of the total dataset.

\subsubsection{Applying the MLPRegressor to Observational data}
In the application of any type of machine aided algorithms it is important to evaluate the results provided. In this section the results of 12 years of data collected as part of the [CAPE VERDE CAMPAIGN] are shown (these contain measurements spanning the entirety of 12 years, which produce the clearest tests for the algorithm). A MLPRegressor of 10 hidden layers, and a hyperbolic tan (tanh) activation function is used \autoref{sec:appendix:tanh}. Additionally the limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (l-BFGS) solver (a quasi-newton method which minimises the inverse of the Hessian matrix\footnote{ The hessian is square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function/field describing the local curvature of a function (of many variables).} to steer through space and obtain a solution) and an adaptive learning rate\footnote{Each time the model improvement fails to decrease the learning loss, the learning rate is reduced by 1/5. This means smaller jumps are made towards the curve peak. } is used. 

Input of the regressor is in the from of a month and a hour, to represent each measurement. This allows it to find not only daily trends, but also seasonal trends within the data. Once trained the regressor is then used to predict a diurnal profile for each month based on the observational data provided. For simplicity $\log_{10}$ values of the concentrations obtained have been used. To validate the results, the predicted MLPRegressor line is compared to a transparent scatterplot for all the results. In addition to this a boxplot showing the IQR, median and mean (green line) plotted alongside to evaluate the predictor output. 

In providing the MLPRegressor with both month and hour inputs, the data is not only fitted hourly (a diurnal avarage), but also across the seasonal/monthly cycles. This accounts for the variation between years and datasets. Since $\log_{10}$ values of the concentrations are used, species such as ozone (\autoref{fig:mlpo3}) which for the Cape Verde dataset (clean air) do not change more than one order of magnitude, the effects of neigbouring months, which shift the diurnal away from the mean (the green line on the boxplot), can be seen. However since this is overall a small change, and the diurnals lie within the inter quartile range, they still provide an adequate approximation. NO (\autoref{fig:mlpno}) on the other hand has a concentration change of several orders of magnitude. Here a distinct daytime peak is seen and is centred around a sesonally consistent mean value of the data. Here the multi-magnitude change in concentration also provides an effective silhouette of the data to which we may compare the fitted line. 
Finally the plots of \ce{NO2} and iso-Pentane (\autoref{fig:mlpno2}-\ref{fig:mlpisopentane}) vary both in diurnal magnitude and seasonally. Within these plots, changes in the data in the january and december months produce deceptively misleading results. Here although the diurnals are not symmetrix, they fit well within the median,mean and interquartile range values, as well as the general data silhouette behind them. This siggests that it is a property of the data that we are fitting, and not that the regressor is producing incorrect results. It is however noted that for a more accurate seasonal prediction, periodic boundary conditions should be employed in the training dataset, where an additional two months are added before January and after December. As only a single value estimate from the summer region will be taken, this does not affect the result accuarcy.

\subsubsection{Model Initialisation Procedure}
The aim is to genearate a set of intiation concentrations which are representative of the different types of chemistry between environments. In this section we are not interested in the exact concentration modelling for specific times or senarios. Instead we seek to generate representative of the processed chemistry under a range of conditions. 

To do this species concentrations are extracted from a MLP regressior trained on observational data for each senario. Each concentration is that of 12:00 local time from the generated diurnal from summer obsrevations at each location. This produces a montly error of $\pm 2 months$ from June. As both nitrogen oxide and dioxide are supplied the total NO$_x$ for each simulation are \emph{not} constrained. The initial conditions are shown in \autoref{tab:icsmetric}.

In general observational measurements are not able to detect all the species presented within the MCM. This means that in order to be able to compare model senarios, the chemistry must first be spun up. In propatating the chemistry forwards in time, primary emitted and measued species are broken up forming the intermediate species which exist within a mechanism. In order to reach steady state, the model is initated at noon and the observational concentrations are rest every 24 hours. For each diurnal the fractional difference between the concentrations at each day are compared. If the difference between these is less than 0.001, the model is left to run unonstrained for 5 days (right of the dashed line in \multiref{fig:ccape}{fig:cbeijing}). Model results are then taken after 3 days of unconstrained runs. The reason for this is that the total RO$_2$ concentration takes longer to stabilise in the polluted environments (London and Beijing). This falls into a periodic cycle beginning noon on the third day, and can provide a representation of the processed chemistry within each environment. 

\textit{NOTE: It should be noted that some of the concentration plots may appear to lose their diurnal dependability. This may be attributed to the changing order of magnitude of the concentrations, and that the species are still responding as expected. }

\subsubsection{Extracting the required results}
Model diagnostics such as concentration and the net flux passing through a species may be extracted directly from the DSMACC box model. These provide the baseline comparison and can be directly compared to the graph metrics. Species concentration tells us the abundance of different species, and the net-flux tells us how fast this is changing with respect to time. 

As some species may have a fast inwards and outwards flux (low net-flux), the aboslute flux is also included. Finally the sensetivity of each species with respect to other species is also extracted (the jacobian matrix). This serves to not only generate the graph used to represent the chemistry, (\autoref{sec:graphconstruction}), but also to identify the overall influence a species has on others in the network. This can be calculated by taking the net sum of the influence a species has on every other from the Jacobian. This is analogous to calculating the outdegree of a node in the jacobian network.

\subsubsection{Unifying the results}
Each metric provides a different range in which it ranks the importance of a node. In order to account for this all results are scaled to the range \{0,1\}, where 1 is the highest. Entries where the results span several orders of magnitude (e.g. concentration, flux, influence) are flattened using the $\log_{10}$ scale before being normalised. 



\subsection{Comparing Results}
This subsection juxtaposes the use of traditional model diagnostic methods against a selection of graph metrics. As there are several thousand species within each simulation run, the keyword extraction algorithm Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), is used to identify the top most prominent species for each metric (traditiona and graph). From this the 10 highest ranking species from each category are collated into a single diagram for comparison. 


\subsubsection{What is TF-IDF}
TF-IDF is a numerical statistuc used in text natural language processing and text mining. It is designed to be identify the importance of a word with regard to its context. 

It provides a value for the frequency a word appears within a documents, offset by the number of times it appears in other documents within the corpus - It is for this reason that 83\% of text recommender systems in digital libraries use TF-IDF, \citep{tf83}. 

 In \citep{frankenstein} I applied this to the chapters of frankenstein, and found the keywords extracted almost exactly replicated those from the synoptic description of the novel. Although TF-IDF is a text mining procedure, the algorithm itself is mathematical, meaning that it may be applied to our diagnostic dataset. The working of the algorithm are discussed below.

\paragraph*{Term Frequency}
The TF from the algorithm name stands for term frequency. This is an analysis of the number of times a word exists within a dataset. There are several ways in which this can be done, these are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] \textbf{Raw Count} - The \textit{number of times} a word exists within the document.
    \item[-] \textbf{Boolean/Logistic} - $True$ if the word exists, false otherwise.
    \item[-] \textbf{Adjusted for Document Length} -  $word\ frequency / total\ number\ of\ words$
    \item[-] \textbf{Log Scaled} - $\log(1+frequency)$
\end{itemize}

As the scaled values for each item are taken, we can liken our results to the `Adjusted for Document length' equation and use the scaled ranking value for each group respectively.

\paragraph*{Inverse Document Frequency}
Inverse document frequency tell us how much information a word provides with respect to a certain context. Whilst a word may be used extensively throughout the corpus (i.e. term frequency) it is often that we are interested in words which are only frequent within a specific document. This is one of the reason TF-IDF is useful in the extraction of keywords from a document. 

The inverse frequency of a word is usually calculated as the $\log$ of the fraction of documents $N$ against the number of documents the word appeas in $D_f$, \autoref{eqn:idf}.


\begin{equation}
    IDF = \log(\frac{N}{D_f})
    \label{eqn:idf}
\end{equation}

If required, changes can be made to produce results which are show a better representation of words which are important for all documents (probabalistic, \autoref{eqn:idfprob}) or individually (smooth, \autoref{eqn:idfsmooth}). However in looking at \autoref{fig:idf}, it can be seen that the basic IDF formula mentioned has a limit of zero the greater the document frequency ($D_f$), which makes it easy to normalise against - i.e. divide by 2 as this is the the value tended to if the document freqnecy tends to 0.    


\begin{equation}
    IDF_{prob} = \log(\frac{N-D_f}{D_f})
    \label{eqn:idfprob}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    IDF_{smooth} = \log(\frac{N}{1+D_f})+1
    \label{eqn:idfsmooth}
\end{equation}




To complete the TF-IDF equation, the term frequency and inverse document frequency terms are multiplied together. 

\paragraph*{Applying TF-IDF to chemical metrics}
To identify a metrics selection criteria, we seek only species which are important only in that category. To do this the TF-IDF algorithm can be adapted for use with the graph metric output. Here `Term Frequency' correspoinds to the number of times a value appears within the body of a document and can be seen as the scaled \{0,1\} metric output. This is then divided by the log of the `Inverse Document Frequency' with $D_f$ being the sum of values across all the metrics. This makes the TF-IDF equation: 

\begin{equation}
    TF.IDF = metric\_value\  .\ \log(\frac{N_o\ documents}{ \Sigma_\forall\ metric\_values})
\end{equation}

        \caption{ \textbf{The different IDF outputs.} A plot showing Inverse Document Frequency profiles against Document Frequency. This shows that the probabalistic IDF hilights words that are more important across all items, whilst the smooth IDF shows files which are more important individually. The general IDF (which is used) produces a result starting at 2 and tending to zero. This provides the best response and can easily be scaled between the range of [0,1] by dividing the output by 2.

        \label{fig:idf}
\end{figure}




\subsection{Metric Comparison}

The aim of this section is to compare the efficiency of graph metrics against a list of traditional methods. To do this the use of a bivariate colourmap (\autoref{fig:cmap}) is used. Each figure consists of a red hued image/heatmap representing the scaled values \{0,1\}:\{white,red\} for each of the individual columns. As each simulation contains thousands of species, only the top 10 species from each column/category are selected. These are then sorted by the average sum of their closeness, betweenness and page-rank values (blue column). Superimposed on this reds-only heatmap is a blue heatmap representing the average sum of the three metrics for comparison. Such a method allows for the comparison of individual values against a an approximation of species importance, by the sum of graph metrics - allowing an easy categorisation of the data:

\begin{itemize}
\item[-] \textbf{Purple} - This value is high in both the individual category and the metric sum. 
\item[-] \textbf{Red} - This value is high for the individual category but not the metric sum. 
\item[-] \textbf{Blue} - This value is high for the metric sum but not the individual category. 
\item[-] \textbf{White} - This value is low for all categories. 
\end{itemize}



\begin{figure}[H]
     \centering
         \includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth,angle=45]{figures_c3/mlpregressor/cbar.pdf}
        \caption{ \textbf{The bivariate colourplot key.} }
        \label{fig:cmap}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Individual Categories}
Individual categories are split between traditional metrics and graph centrality metrics. To represent the importance of a species the following values may be extracted through the use of a simple box model:

\begin{itemize}
\item[-] \textbf{Concentration} - This describes the abundance of a species within the atmosphere. 
\item[-] \textbf{Net Flux} - This describes the rate of net (absolute) change of concentration over time for a species. 
\item[-] \textbf{Absolute Flux} - Some species may have a large flux going through them (production and loss), resulting in a small net flux. This sums the production and loss fluxes. 
\item[-] \textbf{Influence} - Influence is the total magnitude of an effect that changing a species concentration by 1\% would have on other species within the network. Since the graph is generated using the Jacobian matrix, an alternative method for calculating this can be by calculating the total out-degree of a node.  
\end{itemize}



The importance of a species is then compared through the use of three of the most common centrality metrics. These are:


\begin{itemize}
\item[-] \textbf{Centrality} - This describes how easily information from one node can be disseminated to all other nodes. 
\item[-] \textbf{Betweenness} - This describes the number of shortest paths (fastest fluxes/greatest influences) that are routed between nodes adjacent to our chosen node. Species with a high betweenness hold a brokering position, and can act as a bottleneck between different groups of chemistry. 
\item[-] \textbf{PageRank} - PageRank looks at the flow in a system. It ranks nodes not only on the number of species it reacts with, but also the importance of the species it has reacted with.

\end{itemize}

Finally the `Metric Sum' is the sum of all the metric values scaled between 1 and zero (the mean).

\subsection{Testing}
Borneo


As with all scintific processes, it is importatnt to first test the algorithm on a small, comprehensible example. To do this we start with the creation of \ch{ch2oo}. This is a direct product of isoprene. In tracing back all the precursors the mechanism for its creation can be described as: 

\begin{equation}
    \ce{O3 + C5H8 ->[\kappa] CH2OOE}+(MACR\ or\ MVK)\\
    \ce{CH2OOE -> [\kappa_{dec}] CH2OO}
\end{equation}

In traversing the adjoint/reversed graph, this presenets a singe `shortest path' between the product and its precursor. This creates for a base test for the algorithm. The PageRank algorithm is now run with a personalisation vector consisting with an value of 1000000 for the species of interest and -1 for all others. A damping factor value of 0.01 is also used for the algorithm. 

As \ce{CH2OOE} only has one precursor ($\alpha$-pinene) the initial test is done on this. From this the identification of isoprene as a source is sucessful, although since the algorithm is performed on the whole network, there are results for a number of additional species, \autoref{tab:ch2ooe}. This is because page rank works on using teleporation to change between items in the evolution of the system. With the design of the personalisation vector, these values will however be significantly smaller than any containing useful results.

Next we apply the same methodology to \ce{CH2OO}. This creates the graph in \autoref{fig:prtest0}. Here it is seen that \ce{CH2OO} is directly dependant on the radicals \ce{CH2OO[F,B,C,G,A]}, and \ce{CH2OOE}. This is then dependant on Isoprene, which then has a range of dependancies with all have precursors of their own (not shown).
