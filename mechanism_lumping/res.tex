\section{Results: Part I}

In order to get a representation of the mechanism we run 300 randomly initiated scenarios, with the experimental design capable of accepting more data at a later point. We then extract the lifetimes from the diagonal of the jacobian, and convert them into vectors representing the duration of all 3 days for each simulation. 



These vectors are then compared against eachother to find species of similar lifetimes, which follow a like response to the diurnal cycle. This is done through the use of euclidian and cosine similarities.
